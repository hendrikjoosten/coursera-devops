1. # intro to devops

# week 1 overview of devops

### **course intro**

DevOps is the practice of development and operations engineers working together through the entire software development lifecycle, following Lean and Agile principles that allow them to deliver software in a rapid and continuous manner.

### **business case for DevOps**

disrution is inevitable. its not always about new technologies, but often about combinations of technologies into new business models.

but the message here is that technology is the enabler of innovation. It is not the driver of innovation. You must have a great business model idea and a great model and then leverage that technology.

### **devops adoption (cultural change)**

its also about a cultural change.

limit the blast impact when rolling into production. testing live with the market, and do live AB testing. microservices focused architecture .

[The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Gene-Kim/dp/0988262592)

DevOps because DevOps is not about tools.

It's about trust, transparency, communication, coordination, and discipline.

### Definition of DevOps

new team culture

application design (move away from monolith)

automation to handle our microservices

dynamic continously deploying environment

devops is also applying agile to the operations team and having the developers and operations  working together and not in silos anymore. devops is not just about ops automations

dev is the developers. they develop software. then there are the operations side. they do all things that are necessary for the developed code to operate.   This is not DevOps. The Devs are still doing the same thing. This is not just Ops automation. That‚Äôs all it is, automating Ops. DevOps is not just Dev and it is not just Ops. It is DevOps. One word, one team, one set of measurements.

### Essential Characteristics of DevOps

After watching this video, you will be able to: Describe how applications evolved to give rise to DevOps, list the three dimensions of DevOps, and describe some essential characteristics of DevOps. Let's not lose sight of the goal. What is the goal? Agility is the goal.

**There are three pillars for agility.**

One of the pillars is DevOps. This includes cultural change, automated pipelines, infrastructure as code, and immutable infrastructure. speed and agility.

The second pillar is microservices and includes a loosely coupled application design using microservices that communicate via REST APIs. Microservices are designed to resist failure and are tested by breaking them and failing fast.

The third pillar is containers. Containers are developer-centric environments that give us portability and fast startup. They also enable an ecosystem that allows quick deploys with immutable infrastructure.

DevOps has three dimensions: culture, method, and tools.

And the essential characteristics of DevOps include cultural change, automated pipelines,

infrastructure as code, microservices, containers, and immutable infrastructure.

You must change your measurement system and measure differently because you always get

### Leading Up to DevOps

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(3).png)

Well, there's no provision for change

### XP, Agile, and Beyond

pair programming üôÇ

the agile manifesto from snowbird utah

the agile manifesto What they came up with is called the Agile Manifesto. The Agile Manifesto emphasized valuing individuals and interactions over process and tools; working software over comprehensive documentation; customer collaboration over contract negotiation; and responding to change over following a plan.

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(5).png)

Work is done in increments called sprints. Planning is adaptive. We plan for the next two weeks, and then the two weeks after that, and then two weeks after that. Agile includes continuous improvement, that is asking what you learned, and what you are going to do to change.

**but what about ops**

2 speeds IT does not work (when devs and ops work at different speeds)

shadow IT (is when devs goes directly to outside to get stuff done)

**Agile development**

Agile emphasizes valuing individuals, collaboration, responding to change, adaptive planning, early delivery, and continuous improvement

### Brief History of DevOps

2007 to 2019

2007 patrick debois - figured out that dev and ops werent working well together

2008 Patrick Debois attended the Agile Infrastructure ‚ÄúBirds of a Feather‚Äù meeting, organized by Andrew Clay Shafer, in 2008 at the Agile Conference. Debois also started DevOpsDays in 2009.

2009 velocity conference dev and ops coop 10+ deploys a day also the bdevops days in belgium

2010, Jez Humble and David Farley wrote a groundbreaking book called Continuous Delivery

[Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases Through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation (Addison-Wesley Signature Series)](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Jez-Humble/dp/0321601912)

2013 the phoenix project book (listed earlier

2015, Dr. Nicole Forsgren, Gene Kim, and Jez Humble founded a startup called DORA (DevOps

Research and Assessment) that produced what are now the largest DevOps studies to date

called the State of DevOps Report.

2016 the devops handbook

# Summary and Highlights

Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:

- Technology is the enabler of innovation, rather than the driver of innovation. You must have an innovative business idea to leverage technology.
- In 2009, John Allspaw described an innovative approach to managing development and operations that enabled Flickr to complete over ten deploys per day, when many companies were completing fewer than one deploy every six months. This was a key moment in the growth of DevOps.
- DevOps is the practice of development and operation engineers working together during the entire development lifecycle, following Lean and Agile principles that allow them to deliver software in a rapid and continuous manner.
- DevOps is not it is not just Dev and Ops working together. It is a cultural change and a different way to work. DevOps has three dimensions: culture, methods, and tools. Of these, culture is the most important.
- The essential characteristics of DevOps include cultural change, automated pipelines, infrastructure as code, immutable infrastructure, cloud native application design, the ecosystem of containers, and how to deploy with immutable infrastructure.
- DevOps started in 2007 when Patrick Debois and Andrew Clay Shafer began to gather like-minded people together at conferences to talk about common experiences.
- In 2009, Allspaw delivered his now famous ‚Äú10+ Deploys Per Day ‚Äì Dev and Ops Cooperation at Flickr‚Äù presentation and the idea gained ground. Also in 2009, Patrick Debois started a conference called DevOpsDays that helped spread the DevOps message.
- Books such as *Continuous Delivery* in 2011, *The Phoenix Project* in 2015, and *The DevOps Handbook* in 2016, helped practitioners understand how DevOps worked.
- The major influential people of the early DevOps movement: Patrick Debois, Andrew Clay Shafer, John Allspaw, Jez Humble, Gene Kim, John Willis, Bridget Kromhout, and Nicole Forsgren, went out and made a difference, showing the results that could be achieved with DevOps.
- The message spread from practitioner to practitioner until they began to realize what was possible with DevOps and that it was a better way to work.

# week 2 thinking devops

### social coding principles

social coding - coding as a community

**new feature** You open up a GitHub Issue and you assign it to yourself so that everyone knows you‚Äôre working on it. Then you fork the repo, create a branch, and make your changes. When you‚Äôre all done and have something to contribute back, then you issue a pull request signaling that you are ready for a review and the repo owner can decide whether to merge your code back into the main project.

**pair programming** is 2 coders at a single workstation, swapping every so often.

Social coding is done communally with public repositories and all team members are encouraged to contribute. Pair programming results in higher quality code because defects are found earlier, costs are lowered, and there is a broader understanding of the codebase.

### Git Repository Guidelines

each microservice should have their own repository dont do monorepoes (not even if it is easier to demonstrate) you want people to just seee the code that they do care about üôÇ

create a new branch for each issue you are working on. master branch and feture branches.

use pull requests to merge to master (always wanna have 4 hours, dont merge yourself)

**git feature branch workflow**

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(6).png)

### Working in Small Batches

from lean manufacturing, gives fast feedback, doesnt waste too many resources

more experiments more feedback. keeping with devops workflow and cross functional teams.

**working in large vs small batches**

big batch 1000

large flow 50

single piece flow 1 : inspect

**HOW TO SIZE FEATURES**

Working in small batches helps you implement other DevOps practices like Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. So how do you know if your batches are small enough? I would start with the size of your stories in your backlog. Are your application features decomposed in such a way as to support frequent releases? You have to ask yourself, how often are releases possible? Are there delays in the release because the features are too large? Can features be completed in a sprint? If you have features that take several sprints, then your batches are too large. Optimally a feature should be small enough to be completed in a week or less. The features you build are one step toward a goal. Many people feel that only a completed goal is worth shipping. Instead of thinking of useful subsets that can be delivered in increments to gain feedback toward the ultimate goal.

## Minimum Viable Product

A minimum viable product is the minimal thing that you can do to test a value hypothesis and gain learning and understanding. You might say it is the cheapest thing you can do to prove a hypothesis.

at the end of the learning do i pivot or persevere .

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(7).png)

what they wanted vs what they desired.

failure leads to understanding

# Test Driven Development tdd

‚ÄúIf it's worth building, it's worth testing. If it's not worth testing, why are you wasting your time working on it?‚Äù - scott ambler

writing test cases is critical to making sure your code works as intended.

you describe how you want the code to be and then you write the code that does that hhahahaha

super important when thinnking about api design. code is of no use if no one can call it üôÇ

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(8).png)

why is this a part of dev ops

So why is TDD important to DevOps? First and foremost, it saves time when developing. As you add new features to the code or changes to existing features (right?), the test cases will quickly let you know if something broke. It allows you to code faster because you are more confident. You don't have to worry if a change you just made broke something. When you refactor code, you can move much faster because you know the test cases will catch any changes in behavior. TDD ensures that the code is working as you expected. If you write the test cases first to define the behavior you want, you will know that you have achieved that behavior when the tests pass. It also means that future changes don‚Äôt break the code. Failing test cases will instantly alert you that someone has introduced something that broke the code. Finally, and most importantly, in order to create a DevOps pipeline (a CI/CD pipeline), all tests must be automated unless you want to push bugs to production faster.

# Behavior Driven Development bdd

focus on behaviour of the system as seen from outside in.

thinking outside in‚Ä¶ only build what has business value

tdd is inside out - bdd is outside in (high level)

bdd is ensuring the right thing, explore the prblem domain. document the behaviour that the team wants

Gherkin (language) the original name was cucumber

   given   context

   when.   some event happens

   then.     some testable outcome

   and.     is used for continuation

u**ser stories.**

Notice that it uses the "As a," "I need," "So that" syntax; we use this in writing our **user stories.**

# Cloud Native Microservices

the twelve factor app

stateless microservices

each service maintains its own state

resilliance throughhorizontal scaling

instances scaled as needed.

continuous delivery.

"‚Ä¶the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process..." These are not just threads. These are full processes running independently, "...and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource." We now use REST APIs as these lightweight mechanisms. "These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery."  - - - - Martin Fowler and James Lewis

![Richardson-microservices-part1-2_microservices-architecture.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Richardson-microservices-part1-2_microservices-architecture.png)

[Introduction to Microservices | NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/blog/introduction-to-microservices/)

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(11).png)

In this video, you learned Cloud native architecture is a collection of independently deployable microservices. Stateless microservices each maintain their own state in a separate database or persistent object-store. Microservices are loosely coupled services, designed for scalability and communicate with APIs.

# Designing for Failure

mean time to recovery is the most important metric

retry patter. try, fail wait 1 sec. try fail wait 2 sec try fail wait 4 sec etc etc untill you give up üôÇ

circuit breaked pattern - used to avoid cascading failres.. have alternate paths.

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(12).png)

bulkhead pattern

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(13).png)

chaos engineering( monkey testing)

deliberately kill services and see what happens lol. netflix has a tool for this.

Developers need to build in resilience to be able to recover quickly

# Summary and Highlights

Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:

- Social coding is coding as a community and public repositories and pair programming result in higher code quality.
- Working in small batches reduces waste and means quickly delivering something useful to the customer.
- Minimum viable product is as much about delivery as it is about building what the customer really desires.
- Test driven development is writing the test for the code you wish you had, then writing the code to make the test pass. It allows you to develop faster and with more confidence.
- Behavior driven development focuses on the behavior of the system from the outside in. It looks at the system as a consumer of it.
- Behavior driven development improves communication by using an approachable syntax that developers and stakeholders can understand.
- Microservices are built around business capabilities and are independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery.
- Cloud native architecture enables independently deployable microservices that take advantage of horizontal scaling and result in more resilient services.
- Failure is inevitable, so we design for failure rather than trying to avoid failure.
- It is important to embrace failure and quickly recover when failures happen.

# week 3 working devops

# Taylorism and Working in Silos

culture of teaming and collaboration

agile development

automate relentlessly

push smaller releases

taylorism (fred winslow taylor) - large scale manufacturing (c and c management) (siloism)

working in dev ops you must move awa from command and control

# Software Engineering vs. Civil Engineering

project management is not really for software engineering.

project to be completed and then move on.. but software is a continuously developing thing. software stack changes, packages updated, new features,

the project model is flawed when it comes to software denelopmemnt.. rather treat it as product developement

key here is **end to end ownership**

# Required DevOps Behaviors

traditional ops vs devops

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(14).png)

leverage IaC

Devs want innovation, ops want stability this is known as

the wall of confusion

![worked-in-dev.jpeg](devops%20coursera.assets/worked-in-dev.jpeg)

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(15).png)

# Infrastructure as Code

**configuration management systems:** These are tools like Ansible, Puppet, and Chef

**iac:** docker kubernetes Vagrant Terraform

The reason this is so important is because server drift is a major source of failure. Over time, servers get updated for various reasons, and not always by the same people. This causes them to drift from their original configuration.

parallel infrastructure is a product of iac

never make changes to a running container

Ephemeral infrastructure can be used and then discarded. Servers are built on demand, via automation. Rather than patching a running container, immutable delivery is making changes to thecontainer image, then redeploying a new container.

# Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration (CI) is the process of continuously building, testing, and integrating every developer change into the master branch after a set of tests have passed. The result is potentially deployable code. Continuous Delivery (CD) is a series of practices designed to ensure that code can be rapidly and safely deployed to production by delivering every change to a production-like environment. Notice that I said ‚Äúproduction-like.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt have to be deployed into production and, in fact, many people reserve the term ‚ÄúContinuous Deployment‚Äù for when you are deploying continuously to production.

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(16).png)

Speaking of pull requests, every pull request should be built and tested.

master branch should always be deployable

# Continuous Delivery

5 key principles

master branch should always be deployable - - - build and test every change (CI)

CD is more about the piperline and the automation.

**deliver every change to the production like environment!!! - - - its all about a produiction llike env and not necessarily the production environment**

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(17).png)

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(18).png)

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(19).png)

continuousl deplopyment should be called continuous release (CR)

how do yo reducde the risk of all this automation . . . . deploy more and not less.

feature flag (decouple deployment and activation)

canary testing aka zero downtime deployment

# Summary and Highlights

Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:

- Taylorism was designed for factory work and software development is bespoke, that is, more like craftwork, and that working in silos leads to mistakes and bottlenecks.
- Team ownership and stable teams make software development more like product development rather than project management.
- Developers want innovation, while Operations want stability.
- Required DevOps behaviors include shared ownership, collaboration, embracing change, and data-driven responses.
- Infrastructure as Code is describing infrastructure in a textual executable format.
- Ephemeral infrastructure can be used and then discarded because servers are built on demand, via automation, using Infrastructure as Code techniques.
- Continuous Integration is building, testing, and integrating every developer change into the master branch after tests have passed.
- The benefits of Continuous Integration include faster reaction time, moving faster, and reducing the risk in integrating code.
- Continuous Delivery ensures that code can be rapidly and safely deployed to production by delivering every change to a production-like environment.
- The five principles of Continuous Delivery have to do with quality, working in small batches, automation, continuous improvement, and shared responsibility.

# week 4 Organizational Impact of DevOps

# Organizational Impact of DevOps

first become agile:

1. small teams
2. dedicated teams
3. cross functional
4. self organizing teams

Conways law: orgs follow their communication structure

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(20).png)

devops teams examples

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(21).png)

aloign your teams with the business, give them autonomy 5 to 7 engineers and no more than 10

give end to end responsibility

give teams long term missions.

# There is No DevOps Team

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(22).png)

first 4 are shitty

last one is good.. devops works against silos.

just as no one forms an agile team

following lean and agile principles

# Everyone is Responsible for Success

bad behaviour arises when you abstract people away from their consequences

make developers responsible for their code

deal with team mates instead of ticket que

‚Äúyou build it you run it‚Äù

In this video, you learned that actions without consequences can lead to apathy. Allowing teams to feel the effect of their actions fosters empathy, resulting in higher-quality work. Your organizational DevOps objective should be to attain a shared mindset and empower everyone to deliver customer value.

# Summary and Highlights

Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:

- Organizations need to have small, dedicated, cross-functional, self-organizing teams to successfully implement DevOps.
- Conway‚Äôs Law implies that a company‚Äôs design results are a direct reflection of the company‚Äôs communication structure.
- Instead of the traditional structure organized around technology, successful DevOps teams should be organized around business domains. Each team should have its own mission that aligns with a business domain.
- DevOps is a mindset that the whole organization adopts.
- DevOps solves problems caused by siloed teams.
- DevOps is the practice of development and operations engineers working together during the entire software lifecycle, following lean and Agile principles that allow them to deliver high-quality results.
- Actions without consequences can lead to apathy.
- Allowing teams to feel the effect of their actions fosters empathy, resulting in higher-quality work.
- The organizational objective of DevOps is to attain a shared mindset and empower everyone to deliver customer value

# Summary and Highlights

Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:

- Measure and reward what you want to improve.
- People seek information on what is rewarded and then seek to do that.
- Measuring social metrics leads to improved teamwork and measuring DevOps metrics allows you to see the progression toward your goals.
- If you want people to be social, then measure them being social.
- DevOps changes the objective of problem resolution from failure prevention to failure recovery.
- Vanity metrics may be appealing at first but offer limited actionable insights.
- Actionable metrics provide meaningful ways to measure your processes and take action toward goals.
- DevOps actionable metrics include mean lead time, release frequency, change failure rate, and mean time to recovery.
- You can rate statements developed by Dr. Nicole Forsgren to measure your team‚Äôs culture, including statements about information, failures, collaboration, and new ideas.
- Mean lead time is the measure of how long it takes for an idea to get to production.
- Change failure rate is the rate of failure from pushing new releases out.
- Mean time to recovery is how long it takes to recover from a failure.
- Failures are learning opportunities that should not be punished.
- Dr. Nicole Forsgren developed cultural statements for measuring team culture.

- Create an object storage instance on IBM Cloud and add items to your storage

what is cloud computing is the delivery of on demand computer resources‚Ä¶

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(26).png)

### In this lesson, you have learned:

- Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing resources over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis; resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned among multiple users and scale up and down in response to users‚Äô needs.
- The origins of cloud computing can be traced back to the mainframes of the 1950s, with virtualization technologies and hypervisors serving as catalysts for the emergence of modern-day cloud computing.
- Organizations must consider their business needs, investment viability, and risk capacity in order to create a cloud adoption strategy that delivers desired benefits without causing business disruptions and security, compliance, or performance issues.
- Cloud adoption is growing faster than predicted. Driving this technological wave are cloud service providers with a host of services ranging from Infrastructure, Platform, and Software services. Some major Cloud providers of our times include AWS, Alibaba Cloud, Google, IBM, and Microsoft Azure.

### In this lesson, you have learned:

The adoption of cloud technologies is enabling enterprises, big and small, to be agile, innovative, and competitive, and to create differentiated customer experiences. The question organizations are asking is not whether they should move to the cloud, rather what strategy they should adopt to move to the cloud.

Some case studies that demonstrate the impact businesses have created by adopting cloud:

- American Airlines adopting cloud technologies to deliver customer value rapidly across its enterprise
- UBank leveraging cloud platform services to give more control to their developers thereby removing barriers to innovation
- Bitly leveraging the scalability offered by cloud infrastructure for low-latency delivery to its geographically disbursed enterprise customers
- ActivTrades leveraging the infrastructure, storage, network, and security offerings on the cloud to accelerate execution and delivery of new functions in their online trading systems to their customers

### In this lesson, you have learned:

Emerging technologies, powered by the cloud, are disrupting existing business models and creating unprecedented opportunities for businesses to grow, innovate, and create value for their customers.

Some case studies that demonstrate how the use of emerging technologies on the cloud is creating value for millions around the world:

- The use of the Internet of Things on the cloud to combat poaching of endangered rhinos in South Africa
- Artificial Intelligence on the cloud being leveraged to deliver unique digital experiences to millions of fans around the world by the United States Tennis Association
- Blockchain on the cloud helping farmers reduce waste by building traceability and transparency in the food supply chain
- The use of data analytics for driving predictive maintenance solutions for a city‚Äôs infrastructure by KONE

By abstracting the low-level components, cloud infrastructure is helping developers focus

more on business logic than infrastructure management.

Business continuity and disaster recovery require a significant amount of technology

and staff investments.

IaaS is helping organizations reduce this cost and make applications and data accessible

as usual during a disaster or outage.

Organizations are using cloud infrastructure to deploy their web applications faster and

also scale infrastructure up and down as demand fluctuates.

### In this lesson, you have learned:

- Cloud computing allows us to utilize technology as a service, leveraging remote resources on-demand, on a pay-as-you-model. There are three main service models available on the cloud‚ÄîInfrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).
- IaaS provides the fundamental compute, network, and storage resources for customers on-demand.
- PaaS provides customers the hardware, software, and infrastructure to develop, deploy, manage, and run applications created by them or acquired from a third-party.
- SaaS provides access to users to a service provider‚Äôs cloud-based software. Users simply access the applications on Cloud while the Cloud provider maintains the infrastructure, platform, data, application code, security, availability, and performance of the application.

but takes care of the security bullshit VPC

summery

- Deployment models indicate where the infrastructure resides, who owns and manages it, and how cloud resources and services are made available to users. There are three main deployment models available on the cloud‚ÄîPublic, Private, and Hybrid.
- In the Public cloud model, the service provider owns, manages, provisions, and maintains the physical infrastructure such as data centers, servers, networking equipment, and storage, with users accessing virtualized compute, networking and storage resources as services.
- In the Private cloud model, the provider provisions the cloud infrastructure for exclusive use by a single organization. The private cloud infrastructure can be internal to the organization and run or on-premises. Or, it can be on a public cloud, as in case of Virtual Private Clouds (VPC) and be owned, managed, and operated by the cloud provider.
- In the Hybrid cloud model, an organization‚Äôs on-premise private cloud and third-party, public cloud is connected as a single, flexible infrastructure leveraging the features and benefits of both Public and Private clouds.

# week 3 architecture

regions - clusters of data centers

A cloud region, is a geographic area or location where a cloud provider‚Äôs infrastructure is clustered, and may have names like NA South or US East. The cloud regions are isolated from each other so that if one region was impacted by a natural disaster like an earthquake, the cloud operations in other regions would keep running.

**compute** - VMs, bare metal servers, serverless

**storage** - data persistence - block storage and file storage are common, but struggle, object is the best for the cloud

**networking -** software defined networking, public vs private interfaces

   ip adresses and subnets, security groups and access control lists. VLAN,

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(35).png)

## Virtualization and Virtual Machines Explained

hypervisor is software that runs just above the bare metal

type 1 is baremetal (most oft used)

type 2 layer of host OS (hosted hv, virtualbox)

VMs run on top of the HV

multiple VMs on a HV

vms are portable

**benefits**: cost savings, reduce infrastructure footprints

agility and speed - virtuilization is fast and agile

lowers dowtime - moving vms from downded servers

## Types of Virtual Machines

vituals servers, virtual instances, instances

region and zone and OS are user decided

different type

spot vms are for unused capacities

reserved is the opposite

dedicated host is the server for just your machine. meeting compliance and regulatory shit

## Bare Metal Servers

omg they changed the song this video is terrible

- A bare metal server is a single-tenant, dedicated physical server.
- In other words, it's dedicated to a single customer.
- Because bare metal servers are physical machines, they take longer to provision than virtual servers.
- As Bare Metal servers are dedicated for use by a single client at any given time, they tend to be more expensive than similarly sized Virtual Machines.
- Also note that unlike virtual servers, not all cloud providers provide Bare Metal servers.
- If you use any applications that require high degrees of security control or apps that you've typically run in an on-premises environment, then a bare metal server is a good alternative in the cloud.
- When comparing bare metal servers to virtual servers, some of the most important considerations are found in customer need.
- Whereas, virtual servers are rapidly provisioned, provide an elastic and scalable environment, and are low cost to use, however since they share underlying hardware with other virtual servers, they can be limited in throughput and performance.

## Secure Networking in Cloud

As cloud environments gain greater adoption, and digital data invites rapidly increasing cybersecurity threats, building secure networks on the cloud is crucial.

Let's look at how we can build a secure cloud networking presence.

The main difference stems from the fact, that in the cloud, we use logical instances of networking elements as opposed to physical devices.

Subnets are also the main area where security is implemented in the cloud.

Once you build a subnet, then it is time to add some VSIs and storage to it so that you could run your applications.

While public gateways are great for Internet access to the cloud, enterprises are interested in extending their on-premises resources to the cloud by securely connecting them using Virtual Private Networks, or VPNs.

Enterprises with hybrid cloud environment find using dedicated high-speed connections between clouds and on-premises resources is a more secured and more efficient way than public connectivity solutions.

## containers

### In this lesson, you have learned:

Cloud infrastructure consists of data centers, storage, networking components, and compute resources.

Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based version of physical resources, made possible through the use of hypervisors.

A few different types of Virtual Machines can be provisioned on the cloud. These include:

- Shared or Public Cloud VMs that are provider-managed, multi-tenant deployments that can be provisioned on-demand with predefined sizes
- Transient or Spot VMs that take advantage of unused capacity in a cloud data center
- Reserved VMs that allow you to reserve capacity and guarantee resources for future deployments
- Dedicated hosts that offer single-tenant isolation

Bare metal servers are single-tenant physical servers that are dedicated to a single customer. Bare metal servers fulfill the demanding needs of high-performance computing (HPC) and data intense applications and are ideal for applications that have a high degree of security or compliance requirements.

Networking capabilities in the cloud are delivered as a service rather than in the form of rack-mounted devices. Cloud resources, such as VMs (or VSIs), storage, network connectivity, and load balancers, are deployed into subnets within Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). Using private and public subnets allows users to deploy multi-tier enterprise applications securely. Load balancers distribute the traffic and allow applications to be responsive.

Containers are an executable unit of software in which application code is packaged, along with its libraries and dependencies, in common ways so that it can be run anywhere‚Äîdesktops, traditional IT, or the cloud. Containers are lighter weight and consume fewer resources than Virtual Machines - helping streamline the development and deployment of cloud native applications.

# **storage and cdn**

## Basics of Storage on Cloud

[index (1).mp4](devops%20coursera.assets/index%20(1).mp4)

Cloud storage is where you save data and files in the cloud.

Cloud providers host, secure, manage, and maintain the cloud storage and associated infrastructure to ensure you have access to your data when you need it.

Cloud storage is available in four main types ‚Äì Direct Attached, File Storage, Block Storage and Object Storage.

File-based storage is a simple, straightforward approach to data storage and works well for organizing data in a hierarchical folder structure, that desktop users are familiar with.

Block storage is presented to compute nodes using high-speed fibre connections, which means that read and write speeds are typically much faster and reliable than with file storage, making block storage suitable for use with databases and other applications where disk speed is important.

You typically provision block storage in 'volumes', which can then be mounted onto a compute node, which it then effectively sees as another hard drive.

Volumes can normally only be mounted onto one compute node at a time.

With both File and Block storage, you may also hear the term 'IOPS'.

IOPS stands for 'Input/Output Operations Per Second' and relates to the speed of the storage or to put it another way, how quickly data can be read from or written to the storage.

Persistence is a term that is used when provisioning File or Block storage and relates to what happens to the storage once the compute node it is attached to is terminated.

If the storage is set to 'persist' then it will not be deleted along with the compute node, meaning that it and its data are preserved and available to mount onto another compute node, though you will continue to pay for the storage.

## CDN

reduces time for requests by cahing everything locally

# Lesson Summary

### In this lesson, you have learned:

- Cloud storage is available in four main types‚ÄìDirect Attached, File, Block, and Object Storage. These storage types differ in how they can be accessed, the capacity they offer, how much they cost, the types of data they are best suited to store, and their read-write speed.
- Direct Attached (or Local) Storage is storage that is presented directly to a cloud-based server and is effectively either within the host server chassis or within the same rack.
- File Storage is typically presented to compute nodes as a Network File System (NFS), which means that the storage is connected to compute nodes over a standard ethernet network.
- Block Storage is presented to compute nodes using high-speed fiber connections, typically provisioned in volumes, which are mounted onto a compute node.
- Object Storage is accessed via an API and doesn‚Äôt need an underlying compute node. Object Storage offers infinite capacity as you can keep adding files to it and just pay for what you use. Compared to the other storage types, object storage is slowest in terms of read and write speeds.
- A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed server network that accelerates internet content delivery by delivering temporarily stored or cached copies of website or media content to users based on their geographic location.

# week 4 emergent trends and practices

   This week you will learn about some of the emergent trends in cloud computing, such as Hybrid Multicloud, Serverless Computing, and Microservices. You will also learn about how cloud native applications work, the role of DevOps in addressing some of the complexities of cloud computing, and the components of application modernization.

# Hybrid Multi-cloud

is a computing environment that connects and organizations on-premise private cloud and third-party public cloud into a single infrastructure for running the organization's applications. Multicloud is a cloud adoption strategy that embraces a mix of cloud models from different service providers - public, private, and managed, across infrastructure, platform, or software services.

composite cloud

# Microservices

loosely coupled independantly deployble services, own tacks and own containers

communications - apis event streaming and message brokers

Microservices architecture is an approach in which a single application is composed of many loosely coupled and independently deployable, smaller components or services. These services typically have their own stack running on their own containers. They communicate with one another over a combination of event streaming, and message brokers. In this video, we'll look at how microservices have shaped application development, and also look at a use case that illustrates microservices in action. Dream Game is using microservices to improve the user experience for viewers like Ron. When he logs in, he sees the most popular content among all Dream Game users. These three microservices are all in their separate containers ready to join the application. When microservices find each other, they communicate using an application programming interface or an API.

# serverless

The serverless model requires no provisioning of servers, installation of application stacks and software, or operation of the infrastructure by the developer. Serverless computing runs code only on-demand on a per-request basis, scaling transparently with the number of requests being served. Serverless enables end users to pay only for resources being used, never paying for idle capacity, which is unlike virtual servers on the cloud‚Äîwhere end users pay for VMs as long as they are running even if idle. Effectively, serverless abstracts the infrastructure away from developers. Code is executed as individual functions where each function runs inside a stateless container.

Applications that qualify for a serverless architecture include some of the following characteristics: Short-running stateless functions (seconds or minutes). Seasonal workloads with varying off-peak and peaks. Production volumetric data that shows too much idle time. Event-based processing or asynchronous request processing for implementing use cases.

# Lesson Summary

### In this lesson, you have learned:

- Hybrid Multicloud is a cloud adoption strategy that makes it possible for public clouds, private clouds, and on-premises IT to interoperate seamlessly while leveraging the best cloud-based services from different public cloud providers.
- Microservices architecture is an approach in which an application is built as a collection of loosely coupled and independently deployable components or services, leading to efficient development, maintenance, and upgradation cycles.
- Serverless Computing is an approach to computing that offloads responsibility for common infrastructure management tasks for application runtimes to cloud providers, allowing developers to focus their time and effort on development and testing, and not have to worry about provisioning, maintaining and scaling compute resources.

# Cloud Native Applications

a cloud native application is an application developed from the outset to

work only in the cloud environment, or an existing app that has been refactored and

reconfigured with cloud native principles.

A cloud native application consists of microservices working together as a whole to comprise an

application, yet each can be independently scaled and iterated through automation and

orchestration processes.

# DevOps on the Cloud

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(40).png)

Continuous Delivery, which is about delivering

small, well-designed, high-quality, increments of software to customers.

Continuous Integration; creating packaged builds of the code changes released as immutable

images; where immutable implies that when modifications are needed, the entire component

is replaced with an upgraded version.

Continuous Deployment, which involves progressing each new packaged build through the deployment

lifecycle as rapidly as possible.

Continuous Monitoring; with tools that help developers understand the performance and

availability of their applications, even before they are deployed to production.

Delivery Pipeline; which is an automated sequence of steps that involves the stages of

Ideation, Coding, Building, Deploying, Managing, and Continuous Improvement; which loops back

to the Ideation phase in the delivery pipeline.

# Application Modernization

- Many organizations have huge investments in existing applications that are often siloed in legacy systems and are very difficult and expensive to update and maintain.
- Modernizing these applications can unlock great benefits for these organizations such as accelerating their digital transformations, enabling them to take advantage of new technologies and services, and becoming more responsive to their customers' needs and changing market dynamics.
- Cloud computing is one of the three main ingredients in Application Modernization.

# summery

- Cloud native applications are applications that are built or refactored to work in the cloud environment. These applications, developed using DevOps methodologies, consist of microservices packaged in containers that can run in any environment‚Äîmaking it possible to create and update features in quick iterative cycles.
- DevOps is a collaborative approach that enables development and operations teams to continuously deliver software in quick iterative cycles while reducing overhead, duplication, and rework. DevOps‚Äô tools, practices, and processes help tackle the complexities and challenges posed by the cloud, allowing solutions to be delivered and updated ‚Äîquickly and reliably.
- Application Modernization helps organizations accelerate their digital transformation, take advantage of new technologies and services, and become more responsive to changing market dynamics. Cloud computing is one of the key enablers of application modernization.

# Lesson Summary

### In this lesson, you have learned:

- Cloud security refers to the policies, technological procedures, services, and solutions designed to secure the enterprise applications and data on cloud against insider threats, data breaches, compliance issues, and organized security threats.
- Cloud security is a shared responsibility between the cloud provider and the user organization.
- Security architecture and methods for achieving continuous security need to be embedded through the life cycle of an application to ensure that the application runs on a safe platform, the code is free from vulnerabilities, and the operational risks are understood.
- Identity and Access Management, also known as access control, helps authenticate and authorize users, and provide user-specific access to cloud resources, services, and applications.
- As part of their Identity and Access Management services, most cloud providers offer users the ability to define access groups and create access policies that define permissions for users on account resources.
- Cloud encryption, often referred to as the last line of defense, not only encrypts data, but also provides robust data access control, key management, and certificate management.
- Data needs encryption in three states -
- Encryption at rest; protecting data while it is stored
- Encryption in transit; protecting data while it is transmitted from one location to another
- Encryption in use; protecting data when it is in use in memory
- There needs to be active monitoring of all connected systems and cloud-based services to maintain visibility of all data exchanges between public, private, and hybrid cloud environments. This ensures that the cloud provides a trusted platform that can securely integrate with your enterprise data centers.

# case studies and jobs

# week 1 intro to agile and scrum

# Introduction to Agile Development and Scrum

Agile projects fail is inexperience with implementing and integrating the Agile methodology.

executive leadership needs to change their long-term focus and instead focus on delivering value quickly and iteratively to delight their customers.

**agile needs practicing**

and how at the end of every iteration you should ask yourself, "Do we pivot, or persevere?"

# Agile Principles

define the Agile philosophy -

   ‚ÄúAgile is an **iterative** approach to project management that allows teams to be responsive and deliver value to their customers **quickly**.‚Äù small incriments and feedback

describe the characteristics of Agile -

   adaptive planning (short term, small iterations, get feedback)

   evolutionary development (building in small increments)

   early delivery (getting feedback, pivot or persevere)

   continual improvement

   responsiveness to change

explain the philosophy of the Agile Manifesto -

   1. to value individuals and interactions over processes and tools,
   2. working software over  documentation,
   3. customer collaboration over contract negotiation,
   4. and responding to change over following a plan.

   *we value the items on the left more than the items on the right*

agile software development is agile appplied to software devs

transparency is important, small cross functional teams

‚Äúbuild what is needed, not what was planned‚Äù

# Methodologies Overview

# Scrum Overview

agile and scrum have a difference

agile is a philosophy

scrum is a method, management framework

sprint (2 weeks long)

   1 sprint is 1 iteration

STEPS IN THE SCRUM PROCESS

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(48).png)

daily standup -

   what did you do yesterday?

   what did you do today?

   what are your blockers

# The 3 Roles of Scrum

what does a product owner does

what does a scrum master do - mentor for the scrum process

scrum team - (dev team) - cross functional team

**product owner** - represents stakeholder interest, liason, articulate the product vision, final arbiter fo requirements quesions, product backlog and storie groomer. accept or reject product increment, decide wether to ship

**scrum master** - scrum experts with experience‚Ä¶ they are agile coaches, they coach the team. shield the team from the external work, rewolve impediments (blockers) enforce the timeboxes.. capture experience data, no management authority over the team, part of the team not management (needs honesty)

**scrum team** - cross functional team (doing devops) self managing and self assign their own work‚Ä¶ 7 + or - 2, no loners, dedicated to single teams and single products. negotiate commitments one sprint at a time.

In this video, you learn that the product owner represents stakeholders, articulates the product vision, and decides priorities, requirements, and readiness to ship. The Scrum master coaches the team, promotes a cooperative environment, shielding the team from interference and unblocking impediments. The Scrum team is small, dedicated, co-located, cross- functional, and self-managing. The Scrum team negotiates commitments with the product owner one sprint at a time. The Scrum team has autonomy regarding how to reach its commitments.

# Artifacts, Events, and Benefits

**artifacts**

   product backlog (all the stories ever)

   sprint backlog (whats gonna be done in the next sprint)

   done increment (product increment at the end of the sprint)

**events**

   sprint planning meeting (planning)

   daily stand up (sync)

   sprint itself

   sprint review (demo time

   sprint retrospective (what went well, what went not so well, what can we change for the future)

**benefits**

   more productivity

   better code and product quality

   reduced time to market

   increased stakeholder satisfaction

   better team dynamics

   happier employees

scrum is not kanban

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(49).png)

scrum is all about velocity - measure what matters

# Organizational impact of Agile

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(50).png)

   teams should be loosly coupled

   each team has their own mission

   end to end responsibility

   long term mission

**autonomy is important**

   motivation - minimizes decisions

   fast - local decisions

   minimizes handoff and delays

devops is the only way to have a agile software development process

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(51).png)

# Mistaking Iterative Development for Agile

agile is more than iterative development pretty much here the key is that the best way to get real feedback is to deploy and to listen to customers.

there are no agile project managers

# week 2 agile planning

# Destination Unknown

things are gonna keep moving - plan iteratively

measure what matters

dont decide everything at the point when you know the least.

plan for what you kow, adjust as you know more ‚Ä¶. estimates willl be more accurate.

# Agile Roles and the Need for Training

placing people in new roles without training.

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(53).png)

scrum teams need to be cross functional. you cant put people ina. new role without giving them training. gant charts are shit. again its a cultural shift

# Kanban and Agile Planning Tools

agile planning tools alone are not enough, tools support the process

**zenhub - github plugin - github issues can directly be turned into stories**

kanban is ‚Äî todo, doing, done (its all about visualizations)

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(54).png)

# Creating Good User Stories

Simply put, the user story represents a  piece of business value that the team can deliver within a done increment. in the user story there should be

   1. who is it for?
   2. what do they need?
   3. why do they need it?

   assumptions or details..

   the definition of ‚Äúdone‚Äù - gherkin syntax - BDD

story description  - document a persona requesting a function to achiieve a goal

   1. as a (role)
   2. i need (some function)
   3. so that (Some business value)

Bill Wake‚Äôs INVEST - good guidelines for making stories

   independant

   negotiable

   valuable

   estimable

   small

   testable

really big stories are EPIC‚Ä¶ a collection of small stories, usually to be broken down.

**As a** [role]

**I need** [function]

**So that** [benefit]

### Details and Assumptions

- [document what you know]

### Acceptance Criteria

```other
Given [some context]
When [certain action is taken]
Then [the outcome of action is observed]
```

# Effectively using Story Points

what are story points - - its all about how difficult a story would be

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(55).png)

story points are t shirt sizes

   (xs   s  m l   xl  xxl)

      (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)

story anti pattern , dont evaluate stories on wall clock time, its not about wall clock time‚Ä¶

# Building the Product Backlog

   contains all unimplemented stories

   ranked and in order (not all but atleast a few)

   stories at the top should be more detailed

# Summary and Highlights

Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:

- A user story documents a person requesting a function to achieve a goal.
- Using a template helps ensure that stories are complete.
- Defining "done" helps minimize misunderstandings.
- Use the INVEST acronym to remember the qualities of a good user story: independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and testable.
- Epics can be used to capture big ideas.
- Story points are a metric used to estimate the difficulty of implementing a given user story.
- Story points are relative, like T-Shirt sizes.
- You must agree on what "average" means.
- You should never equate story points with wall-clock time.
- A product backlog is a ranked list of all unimplemented stories.
- Stories high in the ranking should have more detail than those that are lower.
- Create stories using the "As a", "I need", "So that" template to ensure everyone understands who it benefits and the business value it provides.

# Backlog Refinement: product owner

RANK ‚Ä¶ MAKE THEM SMALL ‚Ä¶ MAKE THEM DETAILED

who should be in the meeting

      product owner

      scrum master

      1 or max 2 technical people

the goal is to have a ranked backlog

make the stories sprint ready üôÇ

step by step meeting:

   new issue triage - backlog, ice box, reject

   backlog prioritizing

   provide estimates

   large items are split up - make the stories sprint ready

# Backlog Refinement 2

labels help us visualize the work . .

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(56).png)

technical debt - - make it yellow yellow

   this has no direct enhancement for the customer, but its gonna make things esier for us in the future - if you dont do it things might fall apart.

**technical debt** is kinda about doing things right versus doing things fast

code refactoring is also a good example. setting up and ntesting environments, changing technilogies, changing libraries, kinda starting to feel like backend stuff.. kinda important to see why this is so importnat for devops.

do it well before the sprint meeting

each sprint should have a goal - decided by the product owner

and match the stories with the goal

dev team moves stories from the top of the backlog to the sprint backlog

what is the team velocity - its gonna be the amount of story points per sprint

you cannot compare the velocity of 2 teams.

milestones are the goals (sprint 1: counter)

build a sprint backlog from the product backlog

# Summary and Highlights

Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:

- It is the product owner's responsibility to maintain a groomed backlog
- Backlog refinement is used to order the product backlog and make stories sprint ready
- You start refinement by triaging new issues
- Large stories should be broken down until they are small enough to fit in a sprint
- The goal of backlog refinement is to get the backlog ready for the sprint planning meeting
- It is the product owner's responsibility to present the sprint goal
- It¬†is the development team‚Äôs responsibility to create a sprint plan
- A sprint plan is created by moving stories from the product backlog into the sprint backlog until the team's velocity is reached

# week 3 Daily Execution

# Workflow for Daily Plan Execution

the sprint - the sprint is one iteration throught the cycle. its usually 2 weeks and it has a goal

the daily execution: ‚Äútake the highest item and move it to in progress and click on the link to assign it to yourself.

no one should be working on more than 1 feature at a time. i cannot ship 50% of 2 incomplete things. deliver and move on. unless you are blocke, but the block must be worked on.

pull request since its almost done üôÇ

# The Daily Stand Up

daily standup/daily scrum meeting.. same place and time..  15 min timeboxed meeting.

ITS NOT A STATUS MEETING

who should attend:

   scrum master

   development team

   product owner (optional) (they are not to speak)

how to handle the blockers, the scrum master is the one who handles the blockers.. scrum masters to take notes on the tables topics.

TABLED TOPICS - can be discussed after the meeting.

# Using Burndown Charts

it works off of milestones (or your 2 week sprints)

over time the story points  vs days in the sprint

# The Sprint Review

after having a valiable **done increment** . . demo time

done stories are closed then! not before.

everyone should attend the meeting

**feedback should be converted to backlog items**

what do you do about rejected stories, stories that are not considered done, ‚Äúunfinished‚Äù - key to close them and then make a new one, even rejected work still contributes to the velocity.

# The Sprint Retrospective

reflect on the sprint‚Ä¶ measure process health adn team health‚Ä¶ development team need the freedom‚Ä¶ scrum master and developemtn team ‚Ä¶ product owner is iffy‚Ä¶ try to leave the product owner out.. there are 3 questions again:

   what did we do well!

   what did not go well?

   what do we wanna change for the next sprint..

the goal is improvement

## What is Lean Coffee?

Lean coffee is an informal meeting designed to allow participants to set the agenda as they go. Attendees choose what they want to discuss by voting on suggested topics, meaning there is no meeting leader or set-agenda.

Small groups, ideally no more than 10, gather together informally to discuss topics of their choice. This format ensures that the meeting is ‚Äònot just another meeting‚Äô, but actually a productive use of everyone‚Äôs time.

# Summary and Highlights

Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:

- A burndown chart shows the measurement of story points completed vs story points remaining for a sprint
- Burndown charts can be used to show progress and forecast the team's probability of achieving the sprint goal
- A sprint review is a demonstration of the features that have been implemented during the sprint
- Feedback from stakeholders is critical to help shape the future of the product
- The backlog is updated based on feedback
- A sprint retrospective is a time to reflect on how the sprint went
- The sprint retrospective is attended by the scrum master and the development team
- The team must feel comfortable to speak freely
- A sprint retrospective must result in changes to improve the next sprint
- Three questions are answered on what went right or wrong:
- What went well? (keep doing)
- What did not go well? (stop doing)
- What should we change for the next sprint?

# Using Measurements Effectively

vanity metrics vs actionable metrics

you cant improve what you cant measure

A/B split testing is the best way to run experiments

and you really need goood and honest baselines to compare to the past self

actionable metrics

   1. mean lead time
   2. release freq.
   3. change failure rate
   4. mean time to recovery

# Getting Ready for the Next Sprint

end of sprint activities‚Ä¶ close all the done items

close out the current milestone

create a new sprint milestone

adjust unfinished work, sprint backlog moves to the top to the product backlog , dont automatically move them to the next sprint.

unfinshed story, give them credit for the velocity, split the story points to a new story.. unfinished label, closing out the sprint, write a new story for the remaining story points..

keep the velocity accurate

In this video, you learned that it is important to give developers credit for unfinished stories, unfinished stories should be split into new stories to complete the work in the next sprint, each sprint milestone should be closed when completed to reflect the velocity of the sprint, and you should create a new milestone for the next sprint.

# Agile Anti-Patterns and Health Check

- no real product owner (visionary)
- teams are too large
- teams are not dedicated to the team or to the buisinesss case
- if the teams are toooo distributed
- teams should not be siloed
- teams are not self managing

health check

everyone is accouintable and co responsible

working in small sprints

there is an ordered product backlog

there is an ordered sprint backlog

organise the sprint around a goal

re planning during the scrum

post sprint there needs to be a done increment

stake holders feedback.

# github and git knowledge

![Image.png](devops%20coursera.assets/Image%20(61).png)

github, gitlab, bitbucket, beanstalk

- git commands
- git init
- git add
- git status
- git commit
- git reset
- git log
- git branch
- git checkout
- git merge

In this module, you learned that:

A Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) keeps track of changes to code, regardless of where it is stored. This allows multiple users to work on the same codebase or repository, mirroring the codebase on their own computers if needed, while the distributed version control software helps manage synchronization amongst the various codebase mirrors.

Repositories are storage structures that:

- Store the code
- Track issues and changes
- Enable you to collaborate with others

G‚Äãit is one of the most popular distributed version control systems. GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket are examples of hosted version control systems.

# GitHub Branches and Pull Requests

1. create a new local repository using git init
2. create and add a file to the repo using git add
3. commit changes using git commit
4. create a branch using git branch
5. switch to a branch using git checkout
6. check the status of files changed using git status
7. review recent commits using git log
8. revert changes using git revert
9. get a list of branches and active branch using git branch
10. merge changes in your active branch into another branch using git merge

# Module Summary

---

In this module, you learned that:

- Branches are used to isolate changes to code. When the changes are complete, they can be merged back into the main branch.
- Repositories can be cloned to make it possible to work locally, then sync changes back to the original.
- Repositories can be forked to be used as a base for a new project, or so that the developer can work independently.
- A‚Äã Pull Request (PR) can be submitted to have your changes reviewed and merged.
- Large projects include people working in different roles:
- Developer ‚Äì creates code
- Integrator ‚Äì manages changes made by developers
- Repository Administrator ‚Äì configures and maintains access to the repository
